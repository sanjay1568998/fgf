## LactaCare - Human Milk Bank Management System

### Project Overview

**LactaCare** is a web-based human milk management system designed to connect human milk **donors**, **hospitals**, and **administrators** on a single platform to support infants in need of breastmilk. It allows donors to register, complete health screenings, book appointments, and track donation history. Hospitals can request milk for newborns and monitor request status, while admins manage appointments, milk requests, and inventory.

The system also includes awareness pages, location-based milk bank search, and a money donation optionâ€”making the entire milk donation and distribution process **efficient**, **transparent**, and **life-saving** for vulnerable infants.
